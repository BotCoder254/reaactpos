### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reaactpos.git
cd reaactpos
```

2. Install dependencies:

```

## üåê Deployment

### üîÑ Continuous Integration/Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment. Three workflows are configured:

1. **Test and Lint** (`test.yml`)
   - Runs on all branches and pull requests
   - Executes unit tests
   - Performs code linting
   - Uploads test coverage reports
   - Verifies build process

2. **Firebase Deployment** (`firebase-deploy.yml`)
   - Triggers on main branch updates
   - Builds and deploys to Firebase Hosting
   - Requires Firebase secrets configuration

3. **Docker Deployment** (`docker-deploy.yml`)
   - Builds and pushes Docker image
   - Deploys to Render
   - Requires Docker Hub and Render credentials

#### Required Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

```bash
# Firebase Deployment
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT - Firebase service account JSON
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID - Your Firebase project ID

# Docker Deployment
DOCKER_USERNAME - Docker Hub username
DOCKER_PASSWORD - Docker Hub password
RENDER_API_KEY - Render API key
RENDER_SERVICE_ID - Render service ID
```

### Vercel Deployment

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
vercel
```

Configuration file (`vercel.json`):
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "build" }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/static/(.*)",
      "dest": "/static/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/favicon.ico",
      "dest": "/favicon.ico"
    },
    {
      "src": "/manifest.json",
      "dest": "/manifest.json"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Render Deployment

1. Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root:
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:16-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

2. Create `nginx.conf`:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html index.htm;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

3. Deploy to Render:
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select "Web Service"
   - Choose "Docker" as the environment
   - Set the build command: `docker build -t app .`
   - Set the start command: `docker run -p 80:80 app`
